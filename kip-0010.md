## Abstract

This KIP describes the feature of Namespace Access Control (NAC) for Kevacoin key-value database. It allows the owner of a namespace to assign the write access to other users. It also provides the options to limit the write access to certain key patterns, i.e. the user can only create or write to keys that follow the given regular expression patterns. And finally, it allows the original owner of the namespace to revoke the access to the other users.

## Motivation

The current implementation allows one to create a namespace and write any keys to the namespace. However, only one user can have write access to the namespace. This is inflexible as many applications would require multiple users to write to the same namespace, for example, several users collorabting on a wiki document.

## Specification

A new opcode `OP_KEVA_ASSIGN_USER` is introduced to assign the write access to the other user. Like the other existing Keva related opcodes, it is prefixed before a normal transaction output. The Keva opcode will be handled accordingly and after that, it is stripped from the transaction, so that the normal transaction will be performed. In the other words, the Keva operations is piggybacked on the normal transactions, each transaction will require at least 0.01 Kevacoin.

Here is the syntax of OP_KEVA_ASSIGN_USER:

```
OP_KEVA_ASSIGN_USER <NAMESPACE> <USER_NAME> <KEY_PATTERNS>

```
This code is prefixed before a transaction output that sends an amount to the address of the other user. When a node receive this transaction, it performs the following actions:


* In the LevelDB database, create a key `ACL:<NAMESPACE>:<USER_NAME>`, which contains the value `<KEY_PATTERNS>`. This maps the namespace and the user to its key pattern (e.g. `key_prefix*`). The key pattern contains a list of regular expressions for the keys that the user is allowed to create or update. When the key pattern is empty, the user's write access to the namespace is revoked.

* If `ACL:<NAMESPACE>:<USER_NAME>` already exists, this operation will be rejected. That is, the access cannot be assigned to the same user more than once.

After the transaction is confirmed, the user who has been assigned the access will be able to write to the namespace using the new `OP_KEVA_USER_PUT` opcode:

```
OP_KEVA_USER_PUT <NAMESPACE> <USER_NAME> <KEY> <VALUE>
```

A node receives this transaction will check the key pattern specified in the `ACL:<NAMESPACE>:<USER_NAME>` to see if the user has the right to create or update the key. If the user has the right, it will update the value associated with the key, otherwise the operation will be rejected.

Another new opcode `OP_KEVA_UPDATE_USER` can be used to update the key patterns:

```
OP_KEVA_UPDATE_USER <NAMESPACE> <USER_NAME> <KEY_PATTERNS>
```
This opcode updates the key patterns stores in `ACL:<NAMESPACE>:<USER_NAME>`. When the key pattern is an empty string, it effectively revoke the user's write access to the namespace. Only the original owner of the namespace can update the user access (key patterns).

We aim to make this improvement as a soft fork so that the old nodes can still accept or relay the transactions with the new opcodes. To make this possible, we will repurpose the unused opcodes `OP_3`, `OP_4` and `OP_5`. This has been done before as this is how Namecoin introduced its name related opcodes. The old nodes will treat the opcodes as they are today, while the new nodes will interpret them as access control related opcodes. It is critically important that majority of hash power must enforce the new rules to make the activation a success. After the activation, the old nodes can still accept the new transactions, however, they key-value database state will be out-of-sync with the new nodes.

In summary, the following new opcodes are introduced:

| Opecode  | Syntax  | Meaning  |  Repurpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OP_KEVA_ASSIGN_USER  | `<NAMESPACE> <USER_NAME> <KEY_PATTERNS>` | Assign user write access  |   OP_3|   |
| OP_KEVA_UPDATE_USER  | `<NAMESPACE> <USER_NAME> <KEY_PATTERNS>`  | Update user write access with new key patterns  | OP_4  |   |
| OP_KEVA_USER_PUT  |  `<NAMESPACE> <USER_NAME> <KEY> <VALUE>` | Similar to `OP_KEVA_PUT`, but write to the database as a user  | OP_5   |   |



## Deployment

This KIP will be deployed by "version bits" (see Bitcoin BIP9). The bit, start time and timeout TBD.
